---------------------Currently Doing-----------------------
    Rig an animation system that plays the dog animation when both ducks are killed before allowing the next two to spawn


---------- To Do -----------------------
    - Make ducks spawn at edges of screen and move randomly
    - Implement difficulty scaling
    - Make ducks die when hit
    - add scoring system
    - add loose condition and effect
    - add menu and start feature




---------Hit Detection--------
    The math is not perfect but its close enough, make sure it has a tolarence of +/- 1 so all hits are registered
    This should be taken care of by the duck collider functions
